 * MySQL Exercise 2:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Populate each table with at least 5 records.
 *
 *      6.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

            SELECT * FROM students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)

            SELECT first_name, last_name, subject
            	FROM teachers
            WHERE subject = "MATH"

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

            SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, ts.teacher_id, t.first_name, t.last_name
            	FROM students s
            JOIN teachers_students ts ON ts.student_id = s.id
            JOIN teachers t ON t.id = ts.teacher_id
            WHERE t.id = 3

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

            SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.name
            FROM students s
            JOIN students_courses sc ON sc.student_id = s.id
            JOIN courses c ON sc.course_id = c.id
            WHERE c.id = 1

 *          e. update a record in the student table

            UPDATE students
            SET email = "test@email.com"
            WHERE id = 2;

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table

            INSERT INTO teachers (first_name, last_name, subject)
            VALUES ('John', 'Smith', 'Math');

 *
 *       7.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
